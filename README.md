## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- CSS variables via var() and :root
```css
:root {
    /* color */
    --blue-100: hsl(195, 74%, 62%);
    --blue-200: hsl(236, 100%, 87%);
    ...
}
```

- General idea to use classes for literally everything
- How to name selectors
- Couple of VS Code shortcuts like .class which gives you div with class class and h3.class which gives you h3 with class class.
- +- Grid
- How do I tie JS and site together.
- How do I deploy a project.
- How do I commit a solution to Frontend Mentor.
